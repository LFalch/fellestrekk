# Arsehole card game

Arsehole (Danish: RÃ¸vhul) is a Danish (and probably other countries) multiplayer cardgame
where you try to become president and avoid becoming the arsehole.
The whole deck is dealt out as evenly as possible to all players and the object is then to get rid of your whole hand.
At first the person with 3 of Clubs begins

## How to play

Every round the whole deck is dealt out evenly to all players. In the first round, the player with 3 of Clubs begins by playing that card.
The first player is allowed to play more threes along with it if possible to initiate a Double or Triple round.

You go turn by turn playing cards. On your turn, you have to play a card (or cards doing a Double or Triple round) with the same value or higher.
You may choose to Pass instead if you are unable to play or just don't want to play that turn for whatever reason.
You can also play a Sweeper instead to reset the current value and play a new card.
Some variations don't allow you to play a Sweeper when no value is currently set.

## The card values

- 3-9: the number cards from 3-9 have their usual value.
- J-K, A: The picture cards have their numeric values (11, 12 and 13) and then the ace comes after.
- 2: 2 is the highest number card.
- 10, Joker: 10s and Jokers are Sweeper cards. Some variations allow the Joker to counter-Sweep a 10.
